## Credits

This is a fork of previously mentioned [Beautiful Hugo Theme](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo), because I needed it and didn't want to wait for the original author to start working.

I fully plan to backport my (still compatbile) changes to the original theme, which might be hard since I reformatted quite a fiew files to make the HTML rendering more compact and more readable.

## Original Credits

This is an adaptation of the Jekyll theme [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/aboutme#contact). It supports most of the features of the original theme, and many new features. It has diverged from the Jekyll theme over time, with years of community updates.
